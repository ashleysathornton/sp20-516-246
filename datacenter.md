### Wind as Renewable Energy
Energy from the wind is transformed into electricity, often within wind farms, through the use of large blades attached to turbines on top of tall posts (> 100 ft tall) to capture air movement where it is faster.   

### Data centers that use Wind Renewable Energy

While there is increasing capacity from utilities providing wind sourced electricity, it's rare for a data site to have on-site wind generators.  The above web site includes examples of the handful of working data centers that use on-site wind generation to provide power for their servers, including below [@WindDC-sp20-516-246].

**Other World Computing** (Illinois)
Data Center Powered By The Wind

A small lSP and hosting company in Woodstock, Illinois, Other World Computing (OWC) may be the first data center operator in the U.S. to power its facility entirely with wind power from an on-site turbine. In 2009, OWC began using a 131-foot-tall wind turbine to provide all the electric power for its building, which includes the companyâ€™s headquarters and a data center supporting its web hosting and ISP services.

There is growing capacity for wind generated electricity.
For example, Indiana had 2,317 MW of wind capacity in 2018 vs 130 MW in 2008, with the primary purchasers being utility companies: Duke, Vectren, American Electric Power (AEP), Indianapolis Power and Light (IPL), Dominion Energy [@INWind-sp20-516-246]

(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_Indiana>).

"Indiana possesses viable wind resources in much of the northern half of the state (maps: <https://www.in.gov/oed/2425.htm>).  As wind power technology improves, wholesale markets increase and green energy becomes more valuable, Indiana can maximize its wind resources by selling wind power into markets with higher electricity costs. This allows wind producers to find the best markets without jeopardizing Indiana's low electricity rates. As of 2011, wind energy made up 2.7% of Indiana's electricity generation."

According to the US Dept of Energy, wind energy projects bring economic benefits to a region.  Rural electric cooperatives or municipal utilities are encouraged to own community wind projects and use them to diversify electricity supplies and to engage stakeholders in their local energy projects.[@WindEnergy-sp20-516-246] <https://windexchange.energy.gov/projects/economic-impacts>

"Currently, there are several statistics floating around the industry about the cost of downtime. For instance, a frequently-cited 2013 study from the Ponemon Institute states that the price of unplanned downtime in the U.S. costs $7,900 for each minute that ticks by. Another survey from CA Technologies noted that downtime costs small businesses upwards of $55,000 per year, and more than $1 million per year for large enterprises. Gartner analyst Andrew Lerner pegged network downtime at around $5,600 per minute in 2014." [@DCDowntime-sp20-516-246] <https://datacenterfrontier.com/how-calculate-data-center-downtime/>

Blog provides examples of 5 outages and impact to customers [@ExOutages-sp20-516-246]  <https://www.bmc.com/blogs/network-outages/>

A hardware glitch at Navitaire, the external supplier of reservations and check-in systems, failed forcing Virgin Blue to switch to a slower manual check-in system.  The outage resulted in 130 cancelled flights and delays for more than 60,000 passengers, resulting in negative press and damaged reputation. Virgin Blue's reservations management company, Navitaire, ended up compensating Virgin Blue for more than $20 million (Navitaire booking glitch earns Virgin $20M in Compo [@VirginGlitch-sp20-516-246], <https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/navitaire-booking-glitch-earns-virgin-20m-in-compo/news-story/3c66427154c37c864d12cc1302b662d7> )
