Apart from offering the APIs and infrastructure, cloud providers are competing to build tools for data scientists and developers. These tools are tightly integrated with the data platform and compute platform, which will indirectly drive the consumption of VMs, containers, storage, and databases.

But while enterprises might be enthusiastic about the potential of AI, they also recognize that successful deployment of the technology poses significant challenges. In that same survey, 91 percent of respondents anticipated barriers to AI adoption. More specifically, 40 percent didn't believe they had the right infrastructure to support AI. 

 Utilizing cloud AI services offers a number of benefits:

**Access to Advanced Compute Infrastructure** — Machine learning and neural networks require massive amounts of parallel processing power. To meet that need, AI applications must run on systems with advanced graphic processing units (GPUs). However, those systems can be very expensive — making them somewhat impractical for pilot projects. Using a cloud service allows enterprises to get the compute resources they need for AI initiatives while paying only for what they use. And if a pilot project doesn't pan out, they can easily shut it down without being saddled with expensive hardware they no longer need.

**Scalability** — When enterprises experience success with their initial AI efforts, they often want to expand those projects. The cloud makes it easy to scale those projects up or down as demand warrants. And the cloud model makes it easy for companies to broaden the use of the technology to additional departments and business units within the organization.

**Ease of Use** — Competition is fierce for developers and data scientists who understand artificial intelligence technology. As a result, salaries are very high for these professionals. Many organizations find that they can't find or can't afford AI talent, and developing AI skills among their existing workforce takes time. However, the major cloud vendors are meeting this need by rolling out AI services that simplify both the process of creating and training machine learning models and the process of adding speech, image recognition or natural language processing to applications. That, in turn, helps companies overcome any lack of internal AI talent.

**Access to the Latest Technology** — The Teradata survey respondents rightly pointed out that AI technology is still young and changing every day. Because of their AI research and development investments, the major cloud vendors are rolling out new AI capabilities on a regular basis. If an enterprise were to invest in AI hardware and software for its own data centers, they may find that their technology quickly becomes obsolete. But using the AI cloud services allows organizations to stay at the cutting-edge of advancements.

**Low Costs**— This article has already mentioned the financial advantages of cloud-based AI several times, but it bears repeating. The cloud computing model allows organizations to pay only for the computing resources that they are using for their AI application deployments. That eliminates the need for costly upfront capital expenses, allows organizations to convert their infrastructure costs to operational expenses, and often reduces the overall price tag for artificial intelligence projects.
